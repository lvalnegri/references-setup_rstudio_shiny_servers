### Users

- Create a New User: `adduser username`
- Add new user to the *sudo* group (to run commands with superuser privileges): `usermod -aG sudo username`


### Monitor accesses

 - List all the previous attempted login to the system: `sudo less /var/log/auth.log`
 - List the most recent successful login: `last`
 - View the last time each user on the system logged in: `lastlog`

### Mounting hard disks

 - get info on the ids of the attached devices and corresponding partitions: sudo fdisk -l
 - prepare a new directory as mountpoint: sudo mkdir /mnt/newdisk
 - mount the disk: sudo mount -t filesys partname mountpoint
   If filesys is Linux, there's no need for the t option
 - to have devices automatically mpunted st boot, need to edit /etc/fstab:
   - get id of mounted partitions: `blkid`
   - sudo nano /etc/fstab
   - add a line for every mountpoint with following information separated by space:
       <file system> <mount point> <type> <options> <dump> <pass>
 - to unmount any device: sudo umount mountpoint
  
#### Current status
  ```
  sudo mount /dev/sdb1 -t ntfs-3g /home/datamaps/storage/music/
  sudo mount /dev/sdc2 -t ntfs-3g /home/datamaps/storage/media/
  sudo mount /dev/sdd1 /home/datamaps/storage/backup/
  ```
  after blkid these are the results of the new mounted partitions:
  ```
  /dev/sdb1: LABEL="SEAGATE OLD 2TB" UUID="FC006872006835B4" TYPE="ntfs" PARTUUID="2d538674-01"
  /dev/sdc2: LABEL="Repository" UUID="9E904ABF904A9E21" TYPE="ntfs" PARTLABEL="Basic data partition" PARTUUID="e9789d93-9c15-495a-a7c4-d2f1fa5afc0f"
  /dev/sdd1: UUID="c7cb18c7-41c1-4c2f-99fe-74cc744e164b" TYPE="ext4" PARTUUID="000b3eab-01"
  ```
  so we can enter in /etc/fstab the following information for boot time:
  ```
  ```
